Synopsis
--------

Alters the list of possible boot devices from which the system may be booted. When the system is booted, it will scan the devices in the list and attempt to boot from the first device it finds containing a boot image.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7
- Root user or member of security group is required.



Parameters
----------

  force (optional, bool, False)
    Indicates that the boot list must be modified even if the validation of the *speed* and *duplex* attributes, if specified, is not possible.


  normal (optional, list, None)
    Normal boot list. The normal list designates possible boot devices for when the system is booted in normal mode.

    Mutually exclusive with *both*.


    device (True, str, None)
      Specifies the name of the specific or generic device to include in the boot list.

      The following generic device keywords are supported:

      ``fd`` specifies any standard I/O-attached diskette drive.

      ``scdisk`` specifies any SCSI-attached disk.

      ``badisk`` specifes any direct bus-attached disk.

    pathid (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the path ID of the target disk.

      You can specify one or more path IDs by entering a comma-separated list of the required paths to be added to the boot list.

      Specifies the VLAN priority value.


    filename (optional, str, None)
