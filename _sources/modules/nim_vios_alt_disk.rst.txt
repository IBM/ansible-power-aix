nim_vios_alt_disk -- Create/Cleanup an alternate rootvg disk
============================================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Copy the rootvg to an alternate disk or cleanup an existing one.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  action (True, str, None)
    Specifies the operation to perform on the VIOS.

    ``alt_disk_copy`` to perform and alternate disk copy.

    ``alt_disk_clean`` to cleanup an existing alternate disk copy.


  targets (True, list, None)
    NIM VIOS targets.

    Use a dictionary format, with the key being the VIOS NIM name and the value being the list of disks used for the alternate disk copy.


  time_limit (optional, str, None)
    Before starting the action, the actual date is compared to this parameter value; if it is greater then the task is stopped; the format is ``mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm``.


  vars (optional, dict, None)
    Specifies additional parameters.


  vios_status (optional, dict, None)
    Specifies the result of a previous operation.


  nim_node (optional, dict, None)
    Allows to pass along NIM node info from a task to another so that it discovers NIM info only one time for all tasks.


  disk_size_policy (optional, str, nearest)
    Specifies how to choose the alternate disk if not specified.

    ``minimize`` smallest disk that can be selected.

    ``upper`` first disk found bigger than the rootvg disk.

    ``lower`` disk size less than rootvg disk size but big enough to contain the used PPs.

    ``nearest`` disk size closest to the rootvg disk.


  force (optional, bool, False)
    Forces removal of any existing alternate disk copy on target disks.

    Stops any active rootvg mirroring during the alternate disk copy.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - ``alt_disk_copy`` only backs up mounted file systems. Mount all file systems that you want to back up.
   - when no target is specified, copy is performed to only one alternate disk even if the rootvg contains multiple disks




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: Perform an alternate disk copy of the rootvg to hdisk1 on nimvios01
      nim_vios_alt_disk:
        action: alt_disk_copy
        targets:
        - nimvios01: [hdisk1]

    - name: Perform an alternate disk copy of the rootvg to the smallest disk that can be selected
      nim_vios_alt_disk:
        action: alt_disk_copy
        disk_size_policy: minimize
        targets:
        - nimvios01: []
          nimvios02: []
        - nimvios03: []

    - name: Perform a cleanup of any existing alternate disk copy on nimvios01
      nim_vios_alt_disk:
        action: alt_disk_clean
        targets:
        - nimvios01: []



Return Values
-------------

msg (always, str, )
  Status information.


nim_node (always, dict, )
  NIM node info.


status (always, dict, )
  Status for each VIOS tuples (dictionary key).
