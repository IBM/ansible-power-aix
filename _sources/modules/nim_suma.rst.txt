Synopsis
--------

Use the Service Update Management Assistant (SUMA) to download fixes available to update specified target systems up to a specific technology levels (TL) or service packs (SP) level. The fixes are downloaded from the IBM Fix Central website and the related NIM resource is created on the NIM master. The user can then run another task to install the systems with this new resource.

Updates are downloaded based on the lowest technical level of all target systems.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  action (optional, str, preview)
    Controls the SUMA action to be performed.

    ``download`` specifies to download fixes and define the NIM resource.

    ``preview`` specifies to execute all the checks without downloading the fixes.


  targets (True, list, None)
    Specifies the NIM clients to perform the action on.

    ``foo*`` specifies all the NIM clients with name starting by ``foo``.

    ``foo[2:4]`` specifies the NIM clients among foo2, foo3 and foo4.

    ``*`` or ``ALL`` specifies all the NIM clients.

    Can be empty.

    But it cannot be empty when *oslevel* is set to a Service Pack.


  oslevel (optional, str, Latest)
    Specifies the Operating System level to build the resource to update to;

    ``Latest`` specifies to update the target to the latest SP suma can update for the current TL.

    ``xxxx-xx(-00-0000``) specifies to update the target to a specific TL.

    ``xxxx-xx-xx-xxxx`` or ``xxxx-xx-xx`` specifies to update the target to a specific SP.

    Required when *action=download* or *action=preview*.

    When target list is empty *targets=[]*, then *oslevel* cannot be empty *oslevel=""* or *oslevel=Latest*.


  lpp_source_name (optional, str, None)
    Name of the lpp_source NIM resource to create when *action=download*.

    When not specified the lpp_source_name is returned.


  download_dir (optional, path, None)
    Absolute directory path where to download the packages on the NIM server.

    When not set, if a NIM resource *lpp_source_name* exists then it is the resource's location.

    If no NIM ressource exists, then it is set to /usr/sys/inst.images

    Can be used if *action=download* or *action=preview*.


  download_only (optional, bool, False)
    Specifies to perform the preview and download operation only. Do not create the NIM resource.

    Can be used if *action=download*


  extend_fs (optional, bool, True)
    Specifies to automatically extends the filesystem if extra space is needed.

    When *extend_fs=no* and additional space is required for the download, no download occurs.

    When set, a filesystem could have increased while the task returns *changed=False*.

    Can be used if *action=download* or *action=preview*.


  description (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the display name for SUMA task. This is used when viewing existing SUMA tasks in SMIT for example.

    If not set they will be labelled as '*action* request for oslevel *oslevel*'.

    Can be used for *action=download* or *action=preview*.


  metadata_dir (optional, path, /var/adm/ansible/metadata)
    Specifies the directory where metadata files are downloaded.

    Can be used if *action=download* or *action=preview* when *oslevel* is not exact, for example *oslevel=Latest*.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - The **/var/adm/ras/suma.log** file on your system contains detailed results from running the SUMA command.
   - The **/var/adm/ras/suma_dl.log** file on your system contains a list of files that have been downloaded.
   - When you configure SUMA in an AIX logical partition (LPAR) or as the NIM master, it establishes a connection to the fix distribution website and downloads the available service update. The fix distribution website is an IBM server with the domain name of esupport.ibm.com. If your configuration contains a firewall that blocks the connection to the fix distribution website, you must customize the firewall rules to allow SUMA to connect to the following IP addresses 129.42.56.189, 129.42.60.189, 129.42.54.189. SUMA connects to one of these IP addresses based on your geography.
   - You can refer to the IBM documentation for additional information on the SUMA command and configuration settings at https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/s_commands/suma.html.
   - If you hit the known bug that prevents suma from running successfully, contact IBM AIX support and request and ifix for this problem (APAR IJ06197 SUMA MAY CAUSE A NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION) at http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IJ06197.
   - To get assistance for SUMA errors through AIX Support refer to https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10719985.
