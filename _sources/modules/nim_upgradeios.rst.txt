Synopsis
--------

Uses the NIM to perform upgrade to Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) targets tuple.

Checks status of previous operation if provided before running its operations.

VIOSes of a tuple must be on the same cluster and the node states must be OK.

When upgrading VIOSes pair, it checks the cluster state, stop it before installing the VIOS, and restart it after installation.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  action (optional, str, migrate)
    Specifies the operation to perform on the target VIOSes.

    ``migrate`` to use migvios NIM operation to migrate the system software.

    ``viosupgrade`` to use the viosupgrade command to upgrade. Not supported yet.


  targets (True, list, None)

    You can specify a list of a VIOS to update alone, or two VIOSes to update as a couple. There are called tuple.


  time_limit (optional, str, None)
    Before starting the action on a VIOS tuple, the actual date is compared to this parameter value; if it is greater then the task is stopped.
