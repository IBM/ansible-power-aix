==========================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

This module facilitates a. Creation of a volume group b. Modification of attributes of an existing volume group c. Extension of a volume group d. Varyon/Varyoff of a volume group e. Reduction/Removal of a volume group



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX



Parameters
----------

  vg_type (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the type of the volume group.


  enhanced_con_vg (optional, bool, None)
    Specifies Enhanced Concurrent Capable volume group.


  critical_pvs (optional, bool, None)
    Specifies the Critical PVs option for the volume group. If write request failures occur in the mirrored logical volume, the PV is marked as missing and it stops sending I/O requests to the failed mirrored logical volume.


  force (optional, bool, None)
    When *state=present*, forces the volume group to be created on the specified physical volume unless the physical volume is part of another volume group in the Device Configuration Database or a volume group that is active.
When *state=absent*, removes the requirement for user confirmation when delete_lvs has been specified


  delete_lvs (optional, bool, None)
    When *state=absent*, deallocates the existing logical volume partitions and then deletes resultant empty logical volumes


  mpool_strict (optional, str, None)
    Enables mirror pool strictness for the volume group.


  multi_node_vary (optional, bool, None)
    Creates a volume group that is allowed to varyon in non-concurrent mode in more than one node at the same time


  sysstart_avail (optional, bool, None)
    Specifies that the volume group is automatically available during a system restart


  retry (optional, bool, None)
    Enables the infinite retry option of the logical volume.


  mpool (optional, str, None)
    Assigns each of the physical volumes that are being added to the specified mirror pool


  num_partitions (optional, int, None)
    Total number of partitions in the volume group This attribute is valid for scalable volume groups.


  critical_vg (optional, bool, None)
    Enables the Critical VG option of the volume group


  pp_size (optional, int, None)
    Sets the number of megabytes in each physical partition, which is expressed in units of megabytes from 1 (1 MB) through 131072 (128 GB)


  pp_limit (optional, int, None)
    Changes the limit of the number of physical partitions per physical volume. It must be 1 - 16 for 32 PV volume groups and 1 and 64 for 128 PV volume groups


  major_num (optional, int, None)
    Specifies the major number of the volume group that is created


  num_lvs (optional, int, None)
    Number of logical volumes that can be created. This attribute is valid for only scalable volume groups


  vg_name (True, str, None)
    Specifies the volume group name


  state (optional, str, present)
    Specifies the action to be performed on a VG. *present* - Create/Extends/Modifies VG, *absent* - Reduce/Remove VG, *varyon* - Varyon VG, *varyoff* - Varyoff VG


  pvs (optional, list, None)
    Comma separated list of physical volumes









Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: Extend a volume group
      lvg:
        pvs=hdisk1
        vg_name=datavg
        state=present

    - name: Varyon a volume group
      lvg:
        vg_name=datavg
        state=varyon



Return Values
-------------

msg (always, str, Volume group 'rootvg' is in varyon state.)
  The execution message.


stdout (always, str, datavg)
  The standard output


stderr (always, str, 0516-321 mkvg: Physical volume rootvg is not configured.\n 0516-306 mkvg: Unable to find physical volume hdisk3 in the Device Configuration Database.\n 0516-862 mkvg: Unable to create volume group.)
  The standard error
