nim_flrtvc -- Use NIM to generate FLRTVC report, download and install security and HIPER fixes.

Synopsis
--------

Use the NIM master to apply known security and HIPER (High Impact PERvasive) fixes on target systems based on their inventory ensuring the systems are at supported and secure levels.

It downloads and uses the Fix Level Recommendation Tool Vulnerability Checker script to generate a report. It parses this report, downloads the required fixes, extracts the files and checks their versions against installed software levels. It also checks for file locking preventing fix installation. It rejects fixes that do not match these requirements and installs the remaining.

In case of inter-locking file(s) you might want run against the task.

You will get the list of installed and rejected fixes in the results meta data.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  targets (True, list, None)
    Specifies the NIM clients to perform the action on.

    ``foo*`` specifies all the NIM clients with name starting by ``foo``.

    ``foo[2:4]`` specifies the NIM clients among foo2, foo3 and foo4.

    ``*`` or ``ALL`` specifies all the NIM clients.


  apar (optional, str, None)
    Type of APAR to check or download.

    ``sec`` stands for Security vulnerabilities.

    ``hiper`` stands for Corrections to High Impact PERvasive threats.

    ``all`` has the same behavior as ``None`` hence both ``sec`` and ``hiper`` vulnerabilities.


  filesets (optional, str, None)
    Filter filesets for specific phrase. Only fixes that apply to filesets matching the specified phrase will be checked and so updated.


  csv (optional, str, None)
    Path to a APAR CSV file containing the description of the ``sec`` and ``hiper`` fixes.

    This file is usually transferred from the Fix Central server; you can avoid this rather big transfer by specifying the path to an already transferred file.


  path (optional, str, /var/adm/ansible)
    Specifies the directory to save the FLRTVC report.

    All temporary files such as installed filesets, fixes listings and downloaded fixes files are stored in the working subdirectory named '*path*/work'.


  save_report (optional, bool, False)
    Specifies to save the FLRTVC report in file '*path*/flrtvc_<nim_client_name>.txt'.


  verbose (optional, bool, False)
    Generate full FLRTVC reporting (verbose mode).

    It runs the FLRTVC script a second time to save the full report into file. So this option impacts the execution performance.


  force (optional, bool, False)
    Specifies to remove currently installed ifix before running the FLRTVC script.


  clean (optional, bool, False)
    Cleanup working directory '*path*/work' with all temporary and downloaded files at the end of execution.


  check_only (optional, bool, False)
    Specifies to only check if fixes are already applied on the targets.

    **No download or installation** operations will be performed.


  download_only (optional, bool, False)
    Specifies to perform check and download operation only.

    **No installation** will be performed.


  extend_fs (optional, bool, True)
    Specifies to increase filesystem size of the working directory when extra space is needed.

    When set, a filesystem could have increased while the task returns *changed=False*.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Refer to the FLRTVC page for detail on the sctipt https://www14.software.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/flrt/flrtvc.html
   - The FLRTVC ksh script is packaged as a ZIP file with the FLRTVC.ksh script and LICENSE.txt file. It is downloaded from https://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/flrt3/FLRTVC-latest.zip.
   - The script requires ksh93 to use.
   - **v0.8.1** is the current version of the script, depending on changes, this module might need to be updated.
