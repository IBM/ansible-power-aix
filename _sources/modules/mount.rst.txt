Synopsis
--------

This module mounts/unmounts a Filesystem/Device on the specified path.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7
- Privileged user with authorizations: **aix.fs.manage.list,aix.fs.manage.create,aix.fs.manage.change,aix.fs.manage.remove,aix.fs.manage.mount,aix.fs.manage.unmount**



Parameters
----------

  state (optional, str, mount)
    Specifies the action to be performed.

    ``mount`` makes a file system available for use at a specified location (the mount point). In addition, you can use it to build other file trees made up of directory and file mounts. If no parameter is specified, it gets information for the mounted file systems.

    ``umount`` unmounts a previously mounted device, directory, file, or file system

    ``show`` list mounted filesytems


  mount_dir (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the directory path to mount/unmount.


  mount_over_dir (optional, str, None)
    Directory path on which the mount_dir should be mounted.

    If you specify only this directory, it looks up the associated device, directory, or file and mounts/unmounts it.


  node (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the remote node holding the directory/filesystem/device to be mounted/unmounted.


  mount_all (optional, str, None)
    When *state=mount* and *mount_all=all*, mounts all file systems in the /etc/filesystems file with stanzas that contain the true mount attribute.

    When *state=umount* and *mount_all=all*, unmounts all mounted filesystem.

    When *state=umount* and *mount_all=remote*, unmounts all remote mounted filesystems.


  force (optional, bool, False)
    For remote mounted file systems, this attribute forces an unmount to free a client when the server is down and server path names cannot be resolved, or when a file system must be unmounted while it is still in use.


  alternate_fs (optional, str, None)
    Mounts on a file of an alternate file system, other than the /etc/filesystems file.


  removable_fs (optional, bool, False)
    Mounts a file system as a removable file system.


  read_only (optional, bool, False)
    Mounts a file system as a read-only file system.


  fs_type (optional, str, None)
    It specifies the name of the group to mount. It mounts/unmounts stanzas in the **/etc/filesystems** file that contain the type=``fs_type`` attribute.


  vfsname (optional, str, None)
    Specifies that the file system is defined by the vfsname parameter in the /etc/vfs file.


  options (optional, str, None)
    Specifies options. Options should be of the form <option-name>=<value> and multiple options should be separated only by a comma.
