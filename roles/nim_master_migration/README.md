referred to as `nim_master_migration`, which assists in automating in migration in 
migration of NIM master machine.

**NOTES**: 
- This role requires another machine having NIM master setup (***master_a***), master_a should be able to establish SSH connection with the master machine that needs to be migrated.
- This machine (master_a) should be on the level to which you want your master machine (***master_b***) to be migrated.
- Controller node's primary target is master_a, but It should be able to establish SSH connection with master_b (The machine that needs to be migrated) as well.
- To completely migrate the required machine and bring it back to the original state, you need to run the role twice. Once, with phase = "backup_and_migration" and second time with phase = "db_restore"
- ***backup_and_migration*** will initialise the setup required and perform the migration of master_b using master_a as master.
- ***db_restore*** will restore the database and bring the machine (master_b) to previous state.
