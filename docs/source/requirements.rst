Requirements
============

A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server.
However, you cannot run **IBM Power Systems AIX collection** on a Windows system.

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and it is managed
by Ansible. Ansible is not required on a managed node, but SSH must be enabled.

The nodes listed below require these specific versions of software:
