# PREREQUISITES:
# 1. setup NIM master and client connection
# 2. make sure there is a free physical volume
# that does not belong to any volume group and
# has enough space for an alt_disk
# 3. make sure NIM master OS level is at least
# to the desired level for migration
# 4. NIM LPP source for the desired level of
# migration must be created before hand
# 5. c_rsh must be active (should be good if (1)
# is properly setup)
