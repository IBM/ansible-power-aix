> NIM_VIOS_ALT_DISK    (/home/travis/.ansible/plugins/modules/nim_vios_alt_disk.py)

        Copy the rootvg to an alternate disk or cleanup an existing
        one.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= action
        Specifies the operation to perform on the VIOS.
        `alt_disk_copy' to perform and alternate disk copy.
        `alt_disk_clean' to cleanup an existing alternate disk copy.
        (Choices: alt_disk_copy, alt_disk_clean)
        type: str

- disk_size_policy
        Specifies how to choose the alternate disk if not specified.
        `minimize' smallest disk that can be selected.
        `upper' first disk found bigger than the rootvg disk.
        `lower' disk size less than rootvg disk size but big enough to
        contain the used PPs.
        `nearest'
        (Choices: minimize, upper, lower, nearest)[Default: nearest]
        type: str

- force
        Forces action.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- nim_node
        Allows to pass along NIM node info from a task to another so
        that it discovers NIM info only one time for all tasks.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict

= targets
        NIM VIOS target.
        Use a tuple format with the 1st element the VIOS and the 2nd
        element the disk used for the alternate disk copy.
        "vios1,disk1,vios2,disk2" for dual VIOSes. "vios1,disk1" for
        single VIOS.

        elements: str
        type: list

- time_limit
        Before starting the action, the actual date is compared to
        this parameter value; if it is greater then the task is
        stopped; the format is `mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- vars
        Specifies additional parameters.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict

- vios_status
        Specifies the result of a previous operation.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict


NOTES:
      * `alt_disk_copy' only backs up mounted file systems.
        Mount all file systems that you want to back up.
      * copy is performed only on one alternate hdisk even if
        the rootvg contains multiple hdisks
      * error if several `altinst_rootvg' exist for cleanup
        operation in automatic mode
